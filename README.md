# Eligibility rules service exemplar - Research project

## What is this?

18F is conducting research to identify opportunities for developing a web-based eligibility rules service that could be used to make eligibility determinations for a human services program. This _Phase 2_ work follows a prior _Phase 1_ investigation sprint that identified creating such a service as worthy of further exploration. This repository documents Phase 2.

The hypothesis: Both federal and state agencies could achieve greater program efficiencies if the administering federal agency offered a configurable, API-based service that allowed state partner to make eligibility determinations, rather than building and maintaining their own separate rules engines.

## Questions we need to answer

- **Federal partners** - Who are our key federal partners/champions?
- **Program** - Which human services program is the best candidate?
- **Users** - Who are potential first users?
- **Reuse vs. build** - Has a _reclaimable_ system already been built for a state that could repurposed as a general service?
- **Standards** - What are the most important areas to align around, standards to adhere to, and patterns to develop to make adoption the easy choice, without being too prescriptive?
- **Team** - What team would we need for the following build/borrow phase?

## How can you help?

**State human/social services agencies**

If you are part of a state human/social services agency, we're interested in talking with you about your Eligibility & Enrollment system(s), IT modernization plans, and general program eligibility determination methods.
