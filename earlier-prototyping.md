# Early prototyping

## WIC

For our first project, we developed a prototype Eligibility API for The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). This work allowed us to show that we could accommodate varied state policy options into a single Eligibility API ruleset. (Note: The prototype is for demonstration purposes only and is not an official interpretation of policy.)

# DSNAP

For our second project, we developed an Eligibility API for Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) as well as an online Regististration App that uses the API.
