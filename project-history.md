#### Where we've been

Further information on the work we've done during this and the previous phase can be found [in the project wiki](https://github.com/18F/eligibility-rules-service/wiki).

## To be validated

#### :white_check_mark: _Validated (Phase 1):_ TTS has a role to play in the eligibility space
TTS is in a unique position to be a leader, influencing the ecosystem and its actors from a variety of angles due to our ability to work with agencies across the federal government, our experience supporting states through procurement consulting, our ongoing engagement with the vendor community, and our ability to build products and platforms for use across government. _See [Phase 1 Recommendations (Longform)](https://github.com/18F/eligibility-rules-service/wiki/Phase-1-Recommendations-:-Longform)_

#### :white_check_mark: _Validated:_ A finite piece of work appropriate to TTS can be identified
We hypothesize that the highest-value area for TTS to explore further is investigating the value and feasibility of building an API-based eligibility rules web service for a non-MAGI Medicaid human services program, to help federal human service agencies facilitate the adoption of multi-benefit eligibility determination. _See [Phase 1 Conclusions (Pitch)](https://github.com/18F/eligibility-rules-service/wiki/Phase-1-Recommendations-:-Pitch)_

#### :white_check_mark: _Validated:_ Partners will want to collaborate with us to make this happen
Through a series of conversations with potential partners at CMS and FNS, weâ€™ve validated that there are indeed interested partners at the federal level. Through all of these conversations, the general concept resonated and potential use cases were identifiable.

#### :white_check_mark: _Validated:_ States will want to collaborate with us to make this happen
We have identified one state program interested in working with us going forward. While we still intend to identify one or two others, through conversations with states and FNS regional program specialists, we feel confident that problem we are working to address is broadly applicable and that we'll be able to find those partners.  

#### :white_check_mark: _Validated:_ Building or repurposing a rules service is technologically advisable
The level of effort in building out a rules service turned out to be less than anticipated. Our prototype functionality approximated the what we'd anticipate an MVP needing. As such, the effort associated with building a rules service from scratch is low enough to make repurposing an existing system unneccessary.

#### :white_check_mark: _Validated:_ A rules service can be built that allows multiple states with varying eligibility rules to use it
Building off of lessons learned from [MAGI in the Cloud](https://www.medicaideligibilityapi.org/#/application), we wanted to validate we could build a rules service that would accommodate a program where state policies vary considerably. WIC varies both in the income standard which follows the USDA's reduced price school lunch guidelines as well as the policy options implemented at the state level. Our prototype solves for both scenario.

#### :white_check_mark: _Validated:_ TTS's current strategy and direction is aligned with pursuing an effort like this
After presenting our Phase 2 conclusions to the TTS 10x review board, the group that evaluates whether our work is meeting it's objectives and whether it should continue, we were approved to proceed to Phase 3, validating that TTS finds this work valuable and is the kind of work we should be doing.

#### :white_circle: Interested states have technical pathways to adopting a web service-based approach to rules
_Not yet validated - Phase 3_

#### :white_circle: An eligibility rules service offers a faster and cheaper way for states implement rules in their systems
_Not yet validated - Phase 4_
