The Eligibility Rules Service concept has a ton of potential to improve the way health and human services eligibility systems operate and service the public. We believe that the approach we are pursuing can:

- simplify the systems states need to develop and maintain
- make state system modernization faster and more accurate
- clarify benefit program policy
- reduce the oversight burden of both state and federal agencies
- reduce the time for applicants to receive benefits
- reduce vendor lock-in

We recognize that this impact will not be fully realized during the terms of the current team and we want to prepare for continuity of operations. Our work has built upon the lessons learned from prior projects, and we hope to pass on our experience, aspirations and, well, the reins of the project to folks who will be eager and prepared to carry it forward.

To that end, we are establishing an advisory panel of 18F folks who would occasionally meet with the project team to be briefed on progress, achievements, challenges, and federal partners. This will be a small, billable time commitment. We're currently thinking it will involve a monthly review/demo/Q&A session and potentially the odd meeting with our partners to create some face recognition.

If you are interested in joining this advisory panel, please let us know in Slack in #10x-eligibility-srvc.
