# We'd like to hear from you

We are exploring a [general problem](https://github.com/18F/eligibility-rules-service/blob/master/README.md#the-problem) that applies to many different federal/state programs that establish eligibility criteria that determine if an applicant is entitled to receive program services. [We have hypothesized](https://github.com/18F/eligibility-rules-service/blob/master/README.md#our-hypothesis) that creating centralized web services for such programs that many states could use would lead to easier, more efficient implementations of eligibility rules. (Read [_Exploring a new way to make eligibility rules easier to implement_](https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/10/16/exploring-a-new-way-to-make-eligibility-rules-easier-to-implement/) to learn more.)

We are working to prove this hypothesis by working with federal and state agencies to make federal program eligibility criteria available as a web service that we can pilot with state agencies. Currently, we are working with the [D-SNAP program](). If we are able to prove this model to be effective, we hope to spread the approach to other programs.

## We are looking for additional programs and partners

**Federal program agencies:** 

We're specifically looking for federal programs for which the federal agency sets baseline eligibility criteria that states implement in their own eligibility systems. State options that create varied implementations across states are okay; our approach can handle this. If your agency establishes eligibility criteria and then delivers guidance to states, each of which then needs to build out those rules in their eligibility systems, we want to talk to you.

**State and local agencies:** 

If you are from a state agency responsible for implementing eligibility rules for a federal program, there are a couple ways this work could apply to you:
1. If you think the federal program you are responsible for implementing is a good candidate for a centralized rules service, let us know. We've had some very fruitful conversations with folks from states who have helped us identify opportunities. We'd love to learn from you.
2. Our technical approach of building out rules without the use of potentially expensive and proprietary _Business Rules Engine_ products could be useful to you, especially if you are currently thinking about "buying a rules engine". You can get started with our blog post, [_Implementing rules without a rules engine_](Implementing rules without a rules engine). We'd be happy to discuss this work with you as well.
